# Asteroids Study

The goal of this project is to create an asteroids game, roughly based on codes that appeared on chapters 2 and 3 of [*Game Programming in C++*](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Madhav-Game-Programming-in-C-Creating-3-D-Games/PGM1102283.html) by Sanjay Madhav.

The primary intentions are:
- to familiarize myself further with C++
- practice the component pattern
- practice handling simple physics within a 2-dimentional game space
- practice testing, using the [google test framework](https://github.com/google/googletest)
